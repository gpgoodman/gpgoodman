# 👋 Hi, I’m Glenn Goodman

Full-stack engineer building production-ready web apps with **Next.js** & **Supabase** — with a recent focus on **real-world AI search** and performance.

I’m the developer behind **Campvue.com** — helping campers find the perfect site by combining:

- 📍 High-quality campsite visuals + reviews
- 🛟 Privacy, amenities, and terrain insights
- 🧠 Semantic + vector-powered search (in development)

Currently exploring how **LLMs + pgvector + clean data models** can transform trip planning.

## 🏕 Featured Work

### ⛺ Campvue.com (Private Repo)

Production website built using:

- **Next.js App Router** + static rendering and on-demand ISR
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Storage + Auth)
- Dynamic campsite media + rating system
- Fast browsing optimized for mobile travelers

🚀 *Launched in 2025 with growing early-user feedback*  
🎯 *Mission: Help campers see the site before they book it*

You can visit Campvue here → **https://campvue.com**  
*(Drive-thru campsite videos included!)*

### 👆 react-swipe-row (OSS Project)

Scroll-snap rail with trackpad/mouse wheel, touch momentum, keyboard paging (←/→), and optional desktop controls.

- Intentionally unopinionated
- Accessibility is a first class concern
- Zero runtime dependencies
- Free to use- MIT license
- Great example of my front end chops!!
  
👉 Check out the full demo here: https://react-swipe-row.vercel.app/

👉 Check out the npm page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@goodmanlabs/react-swipe-row

**Built with:**
`TypeScript` · `React`

### 🤖 Scout (Private Repo)

AI-powered natural-language search for Campvue using:

- **Supabase `pgvector`** for vector indexing of campsites
- **OpenAI `embeddings`** to generate text embeddings
- **Hybrid semantic + deterministic search** for accurate results
- **Cost-aware RAG** optimized for performance and scale
- **LLM integration** using OpenAI / Anthropic APIs

Built to help campers search by real intent, like:

> “Within 100 miles of Yosemite, find a private site near water with good shade with high user ratings.”

Currently evolving into a fully integrated Campvue experience.

You can try Scout here → **https://campvue-scout.vercel.app/**  
*(Currently in active development! Current version includes pgvector/openai integration for semantic search.  The 'R' in RAG! )*

### 🗂 RIDB Normalizer API

A clean, normalized API surface for federal campground data  
(US Recreation Information Database):

- **Next.js 16** API routes for ingestion + transformation
- **Supabase Postgres** as the authoritative datastore
- **Zod** schemas for compile-time + runtime data validation
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** documentation for consistent integrations

This service feeds structured data into Campvue and Scout-powered search.

## 🧰 Tech I Work With

**Core stack (Preferred Tech)**

`JavaScript` · `TypeScript` · `Next.js (App Router)` · `React`  
`Supabase` · `Postgres` · `pgvector` · `Tailwind CSS` · `Vercel`
`Node.js`

**Supporting tools**

`Zod` · `OpenAPI / Swagger` · `SWR` · `pgvector` · `Jest` · `React Testing Library`

I care about shipping pragmatic, maintainable systems more than chasing shiny abstractions.
