# 👋 Hi, I’m Glenn Goodman

Full-stack engineer building production-ready web apps with **Next.js** & **Supabase** — with a focus on **real-world AI search** and performance.

I’m the creator of **Campvue.com** — helping campers find the perfect site by combining:
- 📍 High-quality campsite visuals + reviews
- 🧭 Privacy, amenities, and terrain insights
- 🔎 Semantic + vector-powered search (in development)

Currently exploring how **LLMs + pgvector + clean data models** can transform trip planning.
