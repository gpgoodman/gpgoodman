# 👋 Hi, I’m Glenn Goodman

Full-stack engineer building production-ready web apps with **Next.js** & **Supabase** — with a focus on **real-world AI search** and performance.

I’m the creator of **Campvue.com** — helping campers find the perfect site by combining:

- 📍 High-quality campsite visuals + reviews
- 🛟 Privacy, amenities, and terrain insights
- 🧠 Semantic + vector-powered search (in development)

Currently exploring how **LLMs + pgvector + clean data models** can transform trip planning.

## 🏕 Featured Work

### ⛺ Campvue.com (Private Repo)

Production website built using:

- **Next.js App Router** + on-demand ISR
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Storage + Auth)
- Dynamic campsite media + rating system
- Fast browsing optimized for mobile travelers

🚀 *Launched in 2025 with growing early-user feedback*  
🎯 *Mission: Help campers see the site before they book it*

You can visit Campvue here → **https://campvue.com**  
*(Drive-thru campsite videos included!)*

### 🤖 Scout (Private Repo)

AI-powered natural-language search for Campvue using:

- **Supabase `pgvector`** for vector indexing of campsites
- **Hybrid semantic + deterministic search** for accurate results
- **Cost-aware RAG** optimized for performance and scale
- **LLM integration** using OpenAI / Anthropic APIs

Built to help campers search by real intent, like:

> “Within 100 miles of Yosemite, find a private site near water with good shade with high user ratings.”

Currently evolving into a fully integrated Campvue experience.

You can try Scout here → **https://campvue-scout.vercel.app/**  
*(Current in active development!)*

### 🗂 RIDB Normalizer API — Open Source

A clean, normalized API surface for federal campground data  
(US Recreation Information Database):

- **Next.js 16** API routes for ingestion + transformation
- **Supabase Postgres** as the authoritative datastore
- **Zod** schemas for compile-time + runtime data validation
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** documentation for consistent integrations

This service feeds structured data into Campvue and the chatbot POC.

## 🧰 Tech I Work With

**Core stack**

`JavaScript` · `TypeScript` · `Next.js (App Router)` · `React`  
`Supabase` · `Postgres` · `pgvector` · `Tailwind CSS` · `Vercel`
`Node.js`

**Supporting tools**

`Zod` · `OpenAPI / Swagger` · `SWR` 

I care about shipping pragmatic, maintainable systems more than chasing shiny abstractions.
